## RealEstate Application
This is a real estate website where the user can explore properties for buying/renting. User can apply Search Filter Queries on the properties list and the results get filtered based on that. Currently we fetch the properties and its details from the rapidAPI Bayut API(https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/bayut) for the demo purpose of the website. 

## How it is built?
This entire Web Application is built using Next.js and Chakra-UI is used for styling the website. I deployed it on the Vercel for the demo purpose.
